# Self Driving Car Project

### Implemented in pure javascript (no ML libraries)

**Goal:** 

Create an animation of a self-driving car that navigates randomly generated traffic. The car will have sensors that enable it to "see" traffic and  road boundaries. Readings from the sensors are fed into a simple neural network that outputs movement controls for the car. Finally a genetic algorithm is used to search the solution space for a car with the right weights to navigate traffic confidently.
